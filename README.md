# Lab Repo

Welcome to my **Lab Repo**!  
This repository is a playground for all things cloud, infrastructure, and DevOps. Here, I experiment with Kubernetes configurations, Terraform modules, monitoring setups, and anything else cool I discover along the way.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

- **Kubernetes**  
  Test configs, manifests, Helm charts, and deployment strategies for learning and experimentation.

- **Terraform**  
  Infrastructure as Code modules for AWS and other cloud providers. Includes VPC setups, networking, security, and more.

- **Monitoring & Observability**  
  Examples and experiments with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, and custom dashboards.

- **Other Cool Stuff**  
  Scripts, automation, CI/CD pipelines, and anything else I find interesting or useful.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse, clone, and use any configs or modules for your own learning or projects.  
Each section has its own README for details and usage instructions.

## Why This Repo?

This is my personal lab for:
- Testing new tech and tools
- Building reusable infrastructure modules
- Documenting learnings and best practices
- Sharing ideas with the community
